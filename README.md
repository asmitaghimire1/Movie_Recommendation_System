# Movie Recommendation System using Cosine Similarity

## Overview
This project is a **Movie Recommendation System** that suggests movies similar to a selected title based on their features. It uses **Cosine Similarity** to measure how closely related movies are in terms of their content and metadata.  
The system takes a movie title as input and returns the **top 20 most similar movies**.

## How It Works
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Selected useful text features such as *genres, keywords, tagline, cast,* and *director*.
   - Handled missing values and text normalization.
   - Cleaned and combined these features into a single string for each movie.

2. **Feature Extraction**
   - Converted the combined textual data into numerical vectors using **TfidfVectorizer**.

3. **Similarity Computation**
   - Computed pairwise **Cosine Similarity** scores between all movie vectors.

4. **Recommendation Logic**
   - When a movie title is given:
     - The system retrieves its corresponding index.
     - Finds movies with the highest similarity scores.
     - Returns the **top 20 most similar titles**.
